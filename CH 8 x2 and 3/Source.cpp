/*  Program Description
2. Write a function print() that prints a vector of ints to cout. Give it two arguments:
a string for “labeling” the output and a vector.

3. Create a vector of Fibonacci numbers and print them using the function from exercise
2. To create the vector, write a function, fibonacci(x,y,v,n), where integers x and y are ints,
v is an empty vector<int>, and n is the number of elements to put into v; v[0] will be x and
v[1] will be y. A Fibonacci number is one that is part of a sequence where each element is
the sum of the two previous ones. For example, starting with 1 and 2, we get 1, 2, 3, 5, 8,
13, 21, . . . . Your fibonacci() function should make such a sequence starting with its
x and y arguments.
